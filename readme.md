## MiniAspire - Laravel Project
- The project focuses on creating a mini version of Aspire so that the
candidate can think about the systems and architecture the real project
would have. The task is defined below:
- Build a simple API that allows to handle user loans. Necessary entities will
have to be (but not limited to): users, loans, and repayments.
- The API should allow simple use cases, which include (but are not limited
to): creating a new user, creating a new loan for a user, with different
attributes (e.g. duration, repayment frequency, interest rate, arrangement
fee, etc.), and allowing a user to make repayments for the loan.
The app logic should figure out and not allow obvious errors. For example a
user cannot make a repayment for a loan thatâ€™s already been repaid.

## MiniAspire - Setup (step by step)

composer install
